Assertions is a header-only assertions library for C and C++.
The reason behind this is the lack of an assertion library for C.
There is [Snowhouse](https://github.com/banditcpp/snowhouse), but that is for C++ and isn't header-only.
The only other real assertions can only be found in test libraries, and none of those are header-only.

This project fills the gap!
It provides a simple, easy-to-use library for writing tests that don't use any dependencies.
